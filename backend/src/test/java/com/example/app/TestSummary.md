## 🚀 Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop running (for TestContainers)
- Java 21+
- Maven 3.6+

### Commands
```bash
# Run all integration tests
mvn test -Dtest="*IntegrationTest"

# Run specific test class
mvn test -Dtest="UserControllerIntegrationTest"

# Run with specific profile
mvn test -Dspring.profiles.active=test
```

### Test Configuration
The tests automatically:
1. Start MongoDB container via TestContainers
2. Configure test database connection
3. Load test data for each test
4. Clean up database state between tests

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Key Technologies
- **TestContainers**: Real MongoDB database for integration testing
- **Spring Boot Test**: Full application context testing
- **AssertJ**: Fluent assertion library for better readability
- **JUnit 5**: Modern testing framework with nested test support

### Database Strategy
- **Container Per Test Suite**: Shared MongoDB container across tests
- **Database Cleanup**: Automatic database dropping between tests
- **Realistic Data**: Test data reflects production data patterns
- **Transaction Testing**: Proper transaction boundary testing

## 🎯 Business Value

### Quality Assurance
- **Bug Prevention**: Catches integration issues before production
