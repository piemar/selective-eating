# üöÄ Alternative Deployment Options

## Option 1: Frontend (Vercel) + Backend (Railway) - RECOMMENDED ‚≠ê
**Cost**: Free frontend + $5/month backend
```
Frontend: https://your-app.vercel.app
Backend:  https://your-app.railway.app
```
**Pros**: Best performance, each service optimized for its purpose
**Cons**: Two services to manage

## Option 2: Everything on Railway
**Cost**: ~$10/month total
```
Frontend: https://your-app-frontend.railway.app  
Backend:  https://your-app-backend.railway.app
```
**Pros**: Single platform, supports both React and Spring Boot
**Cons**: Slightly more expensive, frontend not as optimized as Vercel

## Option 3: Everything on Render
**Cost**: Free tier available, ~$7/month for production
```
Frontend: https://your-app.onrender.com
Backend:  https://your-api.onrender.com  
```
**Pros**: Good free tier, supports both
**Cons**: Free tier has cold starts

## Option 4: Everything on Netlify + Functions
**Cost**: Free tier generous, ~$15/month for pro features
```
Frontend: https://your-app.netlify.app
Backend:  Convert to Netlify Functions (requires major rewrite)
```
**Pros**: All in one place
**Cons**: Would need to completely rewrite Spring Boot as serverless functions

## Option 5: Traditional Cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure)
**Cost**: ~$10-30/month
```
Frontend: AWS S3 + CloudFront
Backend:  AWS ECS or Google Cloud Run
```
**Pros**: Highly scalable, professional
**Cons**: More complex setup, higher cost

## üéØ My Recommendation

**Go with Option 1: Vercel + Railway**
- Deploy frontend to Vercel (free, lightning fast)
- Deploy backend to Railway ($5/month, Spring Boot friendly)
- Best performance and cost ratio
- Each service is optimized for its purpose

**Why not everything on one platform?**
- Vercel is THE best for React frontends (CDN, edge functions, instant deploys)
- Railway/Render are THE best for Spring Boot backends
- Mixing gives you the best of both worlds
